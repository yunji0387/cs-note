<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

## Overview
- A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
- It is crucial for ensuring high availability, handling outages, and accommodating application demand.

## Limitations of Single-Pod Deployments
Single pods can't:
- Handle increased load through load balancing.
- Provide redundancy (single point of failure).
- Ensure high availability or automatic restarts during outages.

## Benefits of ReplicaSet
- **Scalability & Redundancy**: Adjusts the number of running pods to meet the desired state.
- **Failure Handling**: Automatically replaces failed pods.
- **Controlled by Deployment**: It's recommended to manage ReplicaSets through deployments for additional features.

## How ReplicaSet Works
- Doesn't own pods but uses labels to identify which pods to manage.
- Ensures the actual running pods match the desired state.
- Created automatically through deployments.

## Working with ReplicaSet
- A ReplicaSet is generated by default when a deployment is created.
- You can create a ReplicaSet directly using a YAML file with `kind: ReplicaSet`.
- Recommended to use within a deployment for added benefits and easier management.

## Commands for Managing ReplicaSet
- Create a deployment: `kubectl create -f deployment.yaml`
- Check created ReplicaSet: `kubectl get ReplicaSet`
- Create a ReplicaSet directly: `kubectl create -f replicaset.yaml`
- Scale a deployment: `kubectl scale deployment <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> --replicas=3`
- Check running pods: `kubectl get pods`
- Delete a pod: `kubectl delete pod <POD_NAME>`

## Scaling and Desired State
- ReplicaSets allow for scaling operations by adjusting the number of replicas.
- They continuously monitor and maintain the state of pods to ensure it matches the desired configuration.
- If a pod is manually deleted or added, the ReplicaSet takes action to correct the total count back to the desired state.

## Best Practices
- While ReplicaSets can be created directly, it's a best practice to use deployments.
- Deployments offer additional features, including rolling updates.

## Conclusion
- ReplicaSets are essential for high availability, scaling, and resilience in Kubernetes applications.
- They work best under the management of deployments for streamlined updates and features.

## Additional Resources
- More on Kubernetes ReplicaSets can be found in the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).

# Autoscaling in Kubernetes
<details close>
<summary><b>(click to expand/hide)</b></summary>
<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

## Overview
Autoscaling optimizes resource usage and costs by automatically adjusting the number of running instances or resources in response to current demand.

### Objectives
- Understand what autoscaling is.
- Identify the types of autoscalers in Kubernetes.
- Learn how each autoscaler operates.

## Types of Autoscalers

### 1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Adjusts the number of pod instances in a deployment or ReplicaSet.
- Operates based on CPU utilization or other select metrics.
- Responds to the workload changes by scaling the number of pods up or down.

#### How HPA Works
- Metrics like CPU utilization trigger scaling actions.
- As demand increases, HPA increases the number of pods ("scaling out").
- When demand drops, HPA decreases the number of pods ("scaling in").

### 2. Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
- Adjusts the compute resources of containers in pods.
- Increases or decreases the CPU and memory reservations as needed.
- Not typically used alongside HPA for the same resource metrics.

#### How VPA Works
- VPA adjusts the resources of the pods (CPU, memory) based on demand.
- During high demand, VPA increases resources ("scaling up").
- As demand decreases, it reduces the resources ("scaling down").

### 3. Cluster Autoscaler (CA)
- Adjusts the size of the Kubernetes cluster.
- Adds or removes nodes from the cluster based on the overall demand.

#### How CA Works
- When pod requests increase, CA adds new nodes to the cluster.
- CA removes nodes during low demand to optimize resource usage and costs.

## Key Takeaways
- Autoscalers ensure efficient use of resources in a Kubernetes cluster.
- HPA, VPA, and CA serve different purposes and can sometimes be used in combination for effective scaling.
- It's essential to choose the right type of autoscaler based on workload requirements and cost considerations.

## Best Practices
- Use `autoscale` command for HPA instead of manual configuration for ease of use.
- Don't use VPA and HPA together on the same CPU/memory metrics.
- Analyze specific needs to choose the appropriate autoscaler or combination of autoscalers.

# Rolling Updates in Kubernetes
<details close>
<summary><b>(click to expand/hide)</b></summary>
<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

## Overview
This document summarizes the concept of rolling updates in Kubernetes, demonstrating how they provide automated, controlled application updates across pods with zero downtime, and how rollbacks can be efficiently handled.

## Objectives
- Understand what rolling updates are and their workflow.
- Prepare an application for rolling updates.
- Execute and rollback a rolling update.

## What are Rolling Updates?
- Automated updates that incrementally replace application instances with new ones.
- Work with pod templates, particularly deployments.
- No downtime for the application as it updates.
- Allows for easy rollback if the update is problematic.

## Preparing for Rolling Updates
1. **Add Probes**: Implement liveness and readiness probes for deployments, ensuring instances are marked as 'ready'.
2. **Update Strategy**: Incorporate a rolling update strategy in the deployment's YAML file.
   - **maxUnavailable**: Number (or percentage) of pods that can be unavailable during the update.
   - **maxSurge**: Number (or percentage) of pods that can be created above the desired amount.
   - **minReadySeconds**: Minimum number of seconds a pod should be ready for it to be considered available.
   - For zero downtime, set `maxUnavailable` to 0.

## Performing a Rolling Update
- Update the application's image and push the new version to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
- Apply the new image to your deployment in Kubernetes.
- Monitor the status with the `rollout status` command.
- Verify the update by checking the application's output or response.

## Rolling Back an Update
- Use the `rollout undo` command to revert to a previous deployment state if an update is faulty or not required.
- Confirm the changes by inspecting the status of pods or the application's output.

## Strategies for Updates and Rollbacks
- **All-at-once**: Version N-1 is deactivated then version N is activated. This strategy can block user access momentarily.
- **One-at-a-time (Staggered)**: Pods are updated incrementally, maintaining continuous user access.

## Conclusion
- Rolling updates are essential for maintaining applications without interrupting their availability.
- Preparation with the correct parameters is crucial for successful rolling updates.
- Kubernetes allows for efficient rollbacks in case of update failures.
- Both all-at-once and one-at-a-time strategies have their use cases and can be chosen based on the application's tolerance for brief downtimes.

# ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes
<details close>
<summary><b>(click to expand/hide)</b></summary>
<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

## Introduction

This guide provides an overview of ConfigMaps and Secrets within Kubernetes. Both are Kubernetes objects that provide a way to inject configuration data into pods. This allows for the separation of configuration from the application's image, facilitating updates and maintaining sensitive information securely.

## ConfigMaps

### Key Characteristics

- **Purpose**: Store non-confidential data in key-value pairs.
- **Usage**: Decouple configuration details from application code.
- **Size Limit**: Cannot exceed 1MB.
- **Data Fields**: Support for optional data and binary data fields.
- **Naming Restrictions**: Must conform to DNS subdomain names.
- **Reusability**: Can be used across multiple deployments.

### Creation Methods

1. **Using String Literals**: Directly from the command line.
2. **From Properties File**: Using key-value pairs from an existing file.
3. **From YAML File**: Applying a YAML descriptor file.

### Utilization in Pods

- Injected as environment variables via `configMapKeyRef`.
- Mounted as files within pods using volume plugins.

### Practical Usage

- Define ConfigMaps before deploying pods or applications.
- Reference ConfigMaps in deployment descriptors.
- Variables within ConfigMaps are accessible within the application (e.g., `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`).

## Secrets

### Overview

- Similar to ConfigMaps but used for storing sensitive information.
- Content is base64 encoded.

### Creation Methods

1. **Using String Literals**: Create directly from the command line.
2. **From Environment Variables**: Storing each sensitive piece of information as an environment variable.
3. **From Files**: Using a volume that references the Secret.

### Handling Secrets

- Verified through the 'get' and 'describe' commands, but the actual secrets are not plainly visible.
- Can be mounted as volumes or exposed as environment variables.

### Practical Usage

- Secrets are referenced within the application code securely (e.g., `process.env.SECRET_KEY`).
- When mounted as files, applications read from the filesystem to retrieve the secret values.

## Conclusion

ConfigMaps and Secrets are essential Kubernetes features that enhance security and manageability. By externalizing application configuration and sensitive information, they promote best practices in software development and deployment, allowing for more flexible, secure, and modular applications.

# Service Binding in Kubernetes
<details close>
<summary><b>(click to expand/hide)</b></summary>
<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

## Overview

This summary covers the concept of service binding within a Kubernetes environment, emphasizing its role, implementation steps, and usage in applications, particularly using the IBM Cloud Service example.

## Understanding Service Binding

- **Definition**: Service binding connects applications to external services (e.g., databases, APIs, event buses) by managing configurations and safeguarding credentials.
- **Functionality**: It exposes service credentials securely within a Kubernetes cluster, typically through Kubernetes Secrets.

## Key Benefits

- Simplifies application connections to services.
- Automates credential management, enhancing security.
- Avoids hardcoding sensitive information in application code.

## Process of Service Binding

### Step 1: Provisioning the Service

- Create an instance of the desired service, like IBM's Tone Analyzer, either via command line or through the service's UI.

### Step 2: Binding the Service

- Bind the service instance to the Kubernetes cluster, generating credentials that will be used for secure interaction between the application and the service.

### Step 3: Storing Credentials

- Service credentials are stored in a Kubernetes Secret, encoded in base64, ensuring security within the cluster's environment.

### Step 4: Configuring the Application

- Set up the application to access the stored credentials, enabling it to interact securely with the bound service.

## Implementation in Kubernetes

- Service binding credentials become available to applications automatically after binding.
- Credentials can be consumed using `volumeMounts` and `volumes` or injected as environment variables into the application's pods.

## Accessing Secrets within the Cluster

- Use commands like `kubectl get secrets` to list all secrets or access through the Kubernetes Dashboard.
- Secrets can be mounted as volumes or referenced in environment variables within the application's pods.

## Practical Example

- A Node.js application can access service credentials by referencing environment variables such as `binding.APIkey`, `binding.username`, and `binding.password`.
- These credentials are used within the application's code to authenticate and interact with the external service securely.

## Conclusion

Service binding is a critical practice in secure, efficient, and scalable software deployment within Kubernetes environments. It abstracts sensitive credential handling away from application code, promoting security best practices, and simplifying configuration management.
