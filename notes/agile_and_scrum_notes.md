## Definition
Agile is an iterative, collaborative approach to project management, particularly prevalent in software development, enabling teams to deliver value to customers quickly and efficiently.

## Key Characteristics
- **Iterative Development:** Small increments of work, allowing for customer feedback.
- **Adaptive Planning:** Planning in short spans to facilitate flexibility.
- **Evolutionary Development:** Gradual progress, building projects in pieces for easy adjustment.
- **Early Delivery:** Quick, consistent delivery of project parts to receive customer feedback.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regular refining of methods and end-products based on feedback.
- **Responsiveness to Change:** The ability to adapt to project changes swiftly.

## Agile Manifesto
The Agile Manifesto emphasizes:
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.

_While there is value in the items on the right, Agile prioritizes the items on the left._

## Agile Software Development
- Adherence to the principles of the Agile Manifesto.
- Emphasizing flexibility, peer interaction, and customer engagement.
- Maintaining high transparency among team members.
- Utilization of small, co-located, cross-functional, self-organizing, self-managing teams.

## Conclusion
- Agile promotes building what is currently needed by the customer, not just what was originally planned.
- The methodology encourages adaptability and customer-centricity in software development.
- It fosters a dynamic environment of continuous improvement and response to change.

# Software Development Methodologies

## Traditional Waterfall Development

- **Phased approach:** Requirements, Design, Coding, Integration, Testing, Deployment
- **Issues:**
  - Lack of provision for change
  - Discovery of issues late in the process
  - Information loss between phases
  - High cost of mistakes found later in development
  - Long lead times
  - Siloed teams unaware of their impact on others

## Extreme Programming (XP)

- **Introduced:** 1996 by Kent Beck
- **Nature:** Iterative, foundation for Agile
- **Goal:** Improve software quality, responsiveness to changing customer requirements
- **Core Values:**
  - **Simplicity:** Focus on what is necessary, avoid over-engineering
  - **Communication:** Regular interaction within the team
  - **Feedback:** Essential for continual improvement
  - **Respect:** Equal and valuable contribution from all team members
  - **Courage:** Honest estimations, commitments without padding

## Kanban

- **Origin:** Japanese manufacturing systems
- **Key Principles:**
  - **Visualize the workflow:** Important for understanding and managing work
  - **Limit work in progress (WIP):** Focus on completing current tasks effectively
  - **Manage and enhance flow:** Constantly seek improvement and efficiency
  - **Explicit policies:** Clear understanding of the process and 'Definition of Done'
  - **Continuous improvement:** Constant iterative feedback for process enhancement

## Summary

- The **Waterfall approach** is structured and linear but lacks flexibility, leading to potential issues surfacing late in development, causing costly remedies and delayed deliveries.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)** is an agile methodology introduced to improve software quality and responsiveness, emphasizing customer satisfaction and internal team dynamics. Its values are simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage.
- **Kanban** introduces principles from Japanese manufacturing, focusing on visual task management, limiting WIP, and continuous improvement. It emphasizes efficiency, clarity, and process enhancement.

# Agile Development Practices Summary

## Working in Small Batches

- Originates from lean manufacturing principles.
- Helps prevent waste by identifying issues early before they scale.
- Example: Single piece flow in mailing brochures allows immediate quality checks.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Not merely phase one of a project.
- The simplest version of a product used to test hypotheses and gather learnings.
- Focuses on continuous improvement through customer feedback.
- Example: Iterative development from a skateboard to a car based on user needs and feedback.

## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

- Describes the system from the outside in, focusing on user interaction.
- Often applied at integration testing level, testing the systemâ€™s overall behavior.
- Uses Gherkin syntax for clear, understandable scenarios by both stakeholders and developers.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

- A method of testing the system from the inside out.
- Focuses on unit testing and the functionality of individual modules.
- Follows a "Red, Green, Refactor" workflow: write test, write code to pass the test, then improve code.

## Pair Programming

- Involves two programmers working together at one workstation.
- Enhances code quality through real-time review and collaboration.
- Facilitates knowledge sharing and mentorship among team members.
- Leads to early defect discovery and reduced maintenance costs.

## Conclusion

Adopting Agile practices such as working in small batches, developing MVPs, and engaging in BDD, TDD, and pair programming can lead to more efficient production cycles, higher quality products, and more responsive, adaptive development processes.

# Agile vs. Scrum Summary Notes

## Overview
- **Agile**: A philosophy or mindset focused on iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.
- **Scrum**: A methodology implementing Agile principles in a prescriptive and structured manner.

## Scrum in Detail

### Characteristics
- Management framework for incremental product development.
- Emphasizes small, cross-functional, self-managing teams.
- Provides structure through roles, rules, and artifacts.
- Iterative approach using fixed-length increments called "sprints."
- Aims for a potentially shippable product increment after each sprint.

### Challenges
- Easy to understand but difficult to master.
- Requires experience, consider hiring a mentor for guidance.

### The Sprint
- One iteration through the design, code, test, deploy cycle.
- Each sprint has a clear goal.
- Typically two weeks long (varies from one to four weeks).
- Must result in a deployable increment to gather customer feedback.

### Steps in the Scrum Process
1. **Product Backlog**: The comprehensive list of project tasks.
2. **Backlog Refinement**: Grooming tasks to ensure they are ready for the next phase.
3. **Sprint Planning**: Creating a sprint backlog from the product backlog tasks.
4. **Daily Scrum/Stand-up**: Daily team update meeting.
    - What was done yesterday?
    - What will be done today?
    - Any blockers?
5. **Sprint Review and Retrospective**: Assessing the completed work and team's process.

### Iterative Development
- Continuous cycle: Design, code, test, deploy.
- Feedback from each sprint informs the next.
- Central to Scrum, ensuring agility and customer focus.

## Conclusion
- Scrum is an Agile framework with a clear, structured methodology.
- It requires commitment and understanding, often necessitating experienced guidance.
- Sprints keep the team focused and aligned with user feedback.
- The process is iterative, adapting to insights gathered throughout the project's progression.
