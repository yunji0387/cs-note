# Software Development Methodologies

## Traditional Waterfall Development

- **Phased approach:** Requirements, Design, Coding, Integration, Testing, Deployment
- **Issues:**
  - Lack of provision for change
  - Discovery of issues late in the process
  - Information loss between phases
  - High cost of mistakes found later in development
  - Long lead times
  - Siloed teams unaware of their impact on others

## Extreme Programming (XP)

- **Introduced:** 1996 by Kent Beck
- **Nature:** Iterative, foundation for Agile
- **Goal:** Improve software quality, responsiveness to changing customer requirements
- **Core Values:**
  - **Simplicity:** Focus on what is necessary, avoid over-engineering
  - **Communication:** Regular interaction within the team
  - **Feedback:** Essential for continual improvement
  - **Respect:** Equal and valuable contribution from all team members
  - **Courage:** Honest estimations, commitments without padding

## Kanban

- **Origin:** Japanese manufacturing systems
- **Key Principles:**
  - **Visualize the workflow:** Important for understanding and managing work
  - **Limit work in progress (WIP):** Focus on completing current tasks effectively
  - **Manage and enhance flow:** Constantly seek improvement and efficiency
  - **Explicit policies:** Clear understanding of the process and 'Definition of Done'
  - **Continuous improvement:** Constant iterative feedback for process enhancement

## Summary

- The **Waterfall approach** is structured and linear but lacks flexibility, leading to potential issues surfacing late in development, causing costly remedies and delayed deliveries.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)** is an agile methodology introduced to improve software quality and responsiveness, emphasizing customer satisfaction and internal team dynamics. Its values are simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage.
- **Kanban** introduces principles from Japanese manufacturing, focusing on visual task management, limiting WIP, and continuous improvement. It emphasizes efficiency, clarity, and process enhancement.

<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

# Agile Development Practices Summary

## Working in Small Batches

- Originates from lean manufacturing principles.
- Helps prevent waste by identifying issues early before they scale.
- Example: Single piece flow in mailing brochures allows immediate quality checks.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Not merely phase one of a project.
- The simplest version of a product used to test hypotheses and gather learnings.
- Focuses on continuous improvement through customer feedback.
- Example: Iterative development from a skateboard to a car based on user needs and feedback.

## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

- Describes the system from the outside in, focusing on user interaction.
- Often applied at integration testing level, testing the system’s overall behavior.
- Uses Gherkin syntax for clear, understandable scenarios by both stakeholders and developers.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

- A method of testing the system from the inside out.
- Focuses on unit testing and the functionality of individual modules.
- Follows a "Red, Green, Refactor" workflow: write test, write code to pass the test, then improve code.

## Pair Programming

- Involves two programmers working together at one workstation.
- Enhances code quality through real-time review and collaboration.
- Facilitates knowledge sharing and mentorship among team members.
- Leads to early defect discovery and reduced maintenance costs.

## Conclusion

Adopting Agile practices such as working in small batches, developing MVPs, and engaging in BDD, TDD, and pair programming can lead to more efficient production cycles, higher quality products, and more responsive, adaptive development processes.

# Agile vs. Scrum Summary Notes

## Overview
- **Agile**: A philosophy or mindset focused on iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.
- **Scrum**: A methodology implementing Agile principles in a prescriptive and structured manner.

## Scrum in Detail

### Characteristics
- Management framework for incremental product development.
- Emphasizes small, cross-functional, self-managing teams.
- Provides structure through roles, rules, and artifacts.
- Iterative approach using fixed-length increments called "sprints."
- Aims for a potentially shippable product increment after each sprint.

### Challenges
- Easy to understand but difficult to master.
- Requires experience, consider hiring a mentor for guidance.

### The Sprint
- One iteration through the design, code, test, deploy cycle.
- Each sprint has a clear goal.
- Typically two weeks long (varies from one to four weeks).
- Must result in a deployable increment to gather customer feedback.

### Steps in the Scrum Process
1. **Product Backlog**: The comprehensive list of project tasks.
2. **Backlog Refinement**: Grooming tasks to ensure they are ready for the next phase.
3. **Sprint Planning**: Creating a sprint backlog from the product backlog tasks.
4. **Daily Scrum/Stand-up**: Daily team update meeting.
    - What was done yesterday?
    - What will be done today?
    - Any blockers?
5. **Sprint Review and Retrospective**: Assessing the completed work and team's process.

### Iterative Development
- Continuous cycle: Design, code, test, deploy.
- Feedback from each sprint informs the next.
- Central to Scrum, ensuring agility and customer focus.

## Conclusion
- Scrum is an Agile framework with a clear, structured methodology.
- It requires commitment and understanding, often necessitating experienced guidance.
- Sprints keep the team focused and aligned with user feedback.
- The process is iterative, adapting to insights gathered throughout the project's progression.

# Scrum Roles Summary

## Overview
Scrum framework involves three pivotal roles:
1. **Product Owner**
2. **Scrum Master**
3. **Scrum Team**

---

## 1. Product Owner
- **Key liaison** between stakeholders and the Scrum team.
- **Articulates product vision**, ensuring the team understands the directions and goals.
- **Decides on requirement priorities**, controls the product backlog, and adjusts expectations.
- **Authority to accept or reject work results** based on whether the increments meet the requirements and vision.

### Responsibilities
- Represents stakeholders' interests and needs.
- Holds the decision power on continuing or adjusting development paths.
- Ensures the product backlog is refined and ready for sprints.

---

## 2. Scrum Master
- **Facilitates and enforces Scrum processes** and ensures the team follows the agreed-upon rules.
- Acts as a **shield** for the team from external distractions and interferences.
- **Resolves impediments** and focuses on creating a productive work environment.
- **Enforces timeboxes** for various Scrum events to keep the team within schedule.
- **No direct management authority** over the team, acting more as a servant leader and coach.

### Responsibilities
- Coaches the team and helps them to uphold Scrum values.
- Collects empirical data for progress tracking and potential forecast adjustments.
- Encourages a self-organizing and autonomous team environment.

---

## 3. Scrum Team
- **Cross-functional** group involving various roles (developers, testers, business analysts, etc.).
- **Self-organizing and self-managing** with members assigning work to themselves.
- Ideally, teams are small (often recommended as seven plus or minus two) and **co-located**.

### Characteristics
- Members work full-time on the team, dedicated to one project at a time.
- The team commits to work incrementally, one sprint at a time.
- High autonomy in deciding how to meet sprint goals.

### Best Practices
- Co-located teams or at least members being in the same geographical/time zone for better collaboration.
- Long-term dedication to projects, without members being shuffled around.

---

## Conclusion
In Scrum, the **Product Owner** is the vision setter, the **Scrum Master** is the facilitator, and the **Scrum Team** is the executor. Each role complements the others, driving collaborative and efficient project progress. The key to success includes clear communication, understanding of roles, and adherence to the Scrum principles and guidelines.

# Scrum Overview

## Artifacts of Scrum

1. **Product Backlog**
   - A comprehensive list of user stories and requirements for the product that are yet to be completed.
   - May include various backlogs (icebox, release backlog) generally referred to as the product backlog.

2. **Sprint Backlog**
   - User stories selected for completion in the upcoming sprint (typically two weeks).

3. **Done Increment**
   - The product increment completed at the end of a sprint.

## Scrum Events

1. **Sprint Planning Meeting**
   - Attendance: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.
   - Purpose: Plan the work for the upcoming sprint.

2. **Daily Scrum / Stand-up**
   - A daily meeting for status updates and impediment removal.

3. **Sprint**
   - The time-boxed period (usually two weeks) where the team works to complete the selected work.

4. **Sprint Review**
   - A meeting where the team demonstrates the new features to stakeholders.

5. **Sprint Retrospective**
   - The team reflects on the past sprint and plans improvements for the next one.

## Benefits of Using Scrum

- Higher productivity through daily meetings and visibility (via tools like a Kanban board).
- Improved quality via engaged teams and practices like TDD (Test Driven Development).
- Reduced time-to-market due to incremental delivery.
- Increased stakeholder satisfaction through frequent progress visibility.
- Enhanced team dynamics and happiness due to transparency and shared responsibilities.

## Scrum vs. Kanban

- **Cadence**: Scrum has fixed-length sprints, while Kanban is a continuous flow.
- **Release Methodology**: Scrum releases at the end of each sprint, whereas Kanban follows a continuous delivery model.
- **Roles**: Scrum assigns specific roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team); Kanban doesn’t prescribe specific roles.
- **Key Metrics**: Scrum measures velocity; Kanban focuses on cycle time.
- **Change Philosophy**: Scrum limits changes during sprints, while Kanban accommodates changes at any time.

## Conclusion

Scrum, with its structured approach and specific roles and rituals, promotes a productive and collaborative environment that enhances product quality, reduces delivery time, and increases stakeholder satisfaction.
